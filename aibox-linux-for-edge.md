# Step 2: Prepare your Device

This section will guide you to setup connection between IPCamera and AIBox. 

Before starting setup, you may refer to below LED indicator/ Button scenarios at AIBox

## What you will do for network configuration

### 2.1 Network setup for AIBox 

#### 2.1.1 Connect your AIBox with PC via Wi-Fi
At your PC side, please connect to a Wi-Fi network, named as altek_edgebox**** (**** is the last 4 characters of the device’s Wi-Fi MAC address, e.g. altek_edgebox9613). Then, you can follow step 1.1 or 1.2 to redirect AIBox network to Wi-Fi AP or Ethernet router. Password of AIBox AP is "12345678"

![](./images/Pc_network.png)

#### 2.1.2 Direct your AIBox to a Wi-Fi AP

Open web browser (e.g. Chrome) by link http://192.168.143.1/ to  AP setting webpage. 
Then, input SSID/Password for one internet-available Wi-Fi AP. AIBox nework will be redirected to your assigned Wi-Fi AP.

![](./images/ap_webpage1.png) 

Once Wi-Fi connecting successfully, it will redirect to AIBOX IPC preview/config webpage (http://192.168.143.1:9080)

![](./images/ap_webpage2.png)


#### 2.1.3 Direct your AIBox to an ethernet router

If ethernet is connected to AIBOX already, open web browser (e.g. Chrome) by link http://192.168.143.1/, it will be redirected to login webpage automatically.

#### 2.1.4  Login for IPC preview/configure webpage

Please input Username/Password as "admin/admin“, then press "Login" to enter IPC preview/configure webpage.

 #### 2.1.5 Confirm network configuration by Linux shell over SSH
If you already complete above network settings, you can enter linux shell via SSH.
Information for SSH access will be below
-  IP of SoftAP at AIBox: 192.168.143.1
-  Account: root
-  Password: oelinux123

Terminal, like putty, will be available for ssh access

 ![](./images/putty.png)

Once ssh is available, you can use "ifconfig" to check network configurations

![](./images/ifconfig.png)

#### 2.1.6 Update Azure IoTEdge Device connect string via SSH

AIBox support Azure Iot Hub. It can be one Azure Iot Edge Device.
If you already [create your own connect string for Auzre IotEdge Device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux#deploy-a-module), you may use below shell cmd via SSH to update connect string into device.

```
sed -i '/ device_connection_string: /c\  device_connection_string: "HostName={hub_name}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyEdgeDeviceName;SharedAccessKey={key}"' /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
```

Then, you can use below cmd to restart iotedge.service

```
systemctl restart iotedge.service
```

Wait for several minutes to deploy modules from Azure. You can check status by below cmd via SSH

```
docker ps
```

### 2.2 Connect your IPCamera to Wi-Fi AP or ethernet router.

You may prepare x1~x4 IPCameras, compatible with OnVIF + RTSP protocol. 
Please refer to user manual of IPCameras to setup your IPCamera, and direct your camera to to the same Wi-Fi AP or ethernet router as AIBox.

Following cameras are validated with AIBox for your reference.
- Sony: SNC-EB630
- Panasonic: WV-D3131L
- HIKVISION: DS-2CD1021FD-IW1, DS-2CD2042WD-I
- Dahua: HFW4233F-ZSA, HDW-4438C-A, HDW-4438C-A-V2
- Axis: M3007, M3045V
- Vivotek: CC8160


### 2.3 Config your IPCamera via Web UI
At IPC preview/configure webpage, all Onvif IPCs are scanned and listed. And you can press "Refresh“ to scan again.

 ![](./images/ap_webpage4.png)

You have to input username/password for Onvif IPCamera  to login. To simplify operating scenarios, all IPCameras’ account recommend be identical. Then, click camera link to start preview at web

 ### 2.4 Config your display out via Web UI
If you would like have start video analytic or HDMI display, you have to config your display out via Web UI

![](./images/TVOut_config1.png)

Click "Reflash" to scan avaialble IPCameras, then enable x1~x4 cameras as below

Remember to click "Save". After saving configuration, AIBox will reconnect cameras automatically while AIBox boot-up next time.

### 2.5 Reset your network configuration
Pinghole reset button as below. Network configuration will be reset
